            Notes are great to save random tidbits of information; a phone number, a nice gif, a funny picture - anything!

            <b>Available commands are:</b>
            - /save (name) (data): Replying to a message will save that message. Even works on media!
            - /get (name): get the note registered to that word.
            - /clear (name): deletes the note
            - /notes: Lists all notes
            - /saved: same as /notes
            - /noteinfo (name): Shows detailed info about note, who updated and created note

            An example of how to save a note would be via:
            <code>/save data This is example note!</code>
            Now, anyone using <code>/get data</code>, or <code>#data</code> will be replied to with <code>This is example note!</code>.
            
            If you want to save an image, gif, or sticker, or any other data, do the following:
            <code>/save word</code> while replying to a sticker or whatever data you'd like. Now, the note at <code>#word</code> contains a sticker which will be sent as a reply.
            
            Tip: to retrieve a note without the formatting, use <code>/get (name) noformat</code>
            This will retrieve the note and send it without formatting it; getting you the raw markdown, allowing you to make easy edits.

            <code>**bold words**</code>: asterixes are used for bold font. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>
            <code>__italic words__</code>: underscores are used for italics. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>
            <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: this is used for hyperlinks, and will show as such: <a href=\"http://example.com/\">hyperlink</a>. Make sure not to add any extra spaces between the ] and the ( or it won't be valid markdown.

            Markdown is easy, but when you will be making many notes, note by note, you will see obvious flaws, every extra '*' can broke your perfect note."
            How about HTML? Let's try use it instead of markdown. Please read before the 'Markdown' guide."
            
            To use the HTML in the note add the `[format:html]` to the end of note, you can fully disable formatting note by `[format:none]`.

            Making buttons isn't so hard as you expected. Unlike other bots Sophie have many types of custom buttons, let's try to use it!
            Lets start by default url buttons, url buttons have such syntax <code>[Button name](buttonurl:https://url.com)</code>.
            
            Ok, you added many buttons to your message, but it looks ugly? You wanna make few buttons per line? This will help you:
            Add <code>:same</code> at the end of your link; it'll set it on the same line as the other one. For example:
            <code>[Button 1](buttonurl:https://url.com)</code>\n[Button 2](buttonurl:https://url.com:same)
            You can set more than 2 buttons per row, do not overdo it.
            
            Ok, you just created you note with many buttons, you will see that you do not have enough just url buttons, see other's:
            - <code>[Button name](buttonnote:name_of_note)</code>: With such types of button you will get a note in your PM, this done to prevent spamming notes in pm.
            - <code>[Button name](buttonalert:name_of_note)</code>: This one will show you popup with note data (Warning, only text supported by popups), for example this can be done for rules, you are limited only by your imagination and by 200 symbols limit for popups
            - <code>[Button name](deletemsg:admin)</code>: Some notes used by warning, or notify, after reading it it leaving in chat, it spammy, right? This button will remove message, it have argument to control which one can be remove message `user` or `admin`.
            \nCreate your beautiful and functional notes with Sophie.
        enc: |
            Sophie respects your privacy, you are allowed to encrypt your notes to save your data privacy.
            By default all notes are encrypted with particle method.
            Just add a <code>[encryption:fully]</code> in note text to encrypt it fully with password requesting.
            Example:
            <code>/save test_note This is a text of test_note [encryption:fully]</code>

            You can also disable encryption fully by <code>[encryption:no]</code>
