  <i>Decorate your text with MrPropper</i>

  <u>Parsing</u>
  By default, Sophie format your texts with HTML.
  You can change parse mode to 'Markdown' or 'None'

  for example, you could change parse mode to Markdown by following syntax:
  <code>%PARSEMODE_MD</code> (Replace 'MD' with 'None' if you dont want to parse your text)

  Recently Telegram added formatting options to their clients, thus we also support inbuilt formatting.
  We found out that it is the most feasible method to format texts.
  Although we discourage you to use both inbuilt formatting and Sophie's formatting simultaneously

  Here's some supported HTML tags,

  <code>&lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/b&gt;</code> for <b>Bold</b>
  <code>&lt;i&gt;Italics&lt;/i&gt;</code> for <i>Italics</i>
  <code>&lt;s&gt;Strikethrough&lt;/s&gt;</code> for <s>Strikethrough</s>
  <code>&lt;u&gt;Underline&lt;/u&gt;</code> for <u>Underline</u>
  <code>&lt;a href="wiki.sophiebot.gq"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> for <a href="wiki.sophiebot.gq">link</a>
  <code>&lt;code&gt;Monospace&lt;/code&gt;</code> for <code>Monospace</code>

  <u>Webpage preview</u>
  To have webpage in your message, just add <code>%PREVIEW</code> in your text.

  <u>Buttons</u>
  You could find help about adding <i>module-based</i> buttons in their respective help pages such as notes, rules, etc..
  Here, We gonna talk about some general buttons which ain't based on modules, specifically, URL buttons.

  Do you want to add a link to your website in welcome message? Do this
  <code>[button name](url:https://www.google.com)</code> thats it!

  Again, you can find help about similar buttons in their respective pages!

  <u>Variables</u>
  Here's some supported variables.
  <code>{id}</code> Unique ID of the user. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{first}</code> for first name of user. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{last}</code> for last name of user, can be empty!. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{mention}</code> for mention-ing user with their first name. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{username}</code> yes! mentions by username, if there's no username, mentions by first name. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{fullname}</code> full name of the user. (supported specifiers: <code>!reply</code>)
  <code>{chatid}</code> ID of the chat
  <code>{chatname}</code> title of the chat.
  <code>{chatnick}</code> username of the chat.

  You can add specifiers in certain variables, for example, Specifiers are usable if you want to mention user you replied to,
  <code>Hey {mention!reply}</code>
  Now this mentions the user you had replied to, don't worry, if there's no replied message it would work like as it before.
  Only certain variables support this, those who has 'specs supported' in brackets, rest in monospace is supported specifiers

  Don't know how to use variables?
  An example is: '<code>HeOwO {first}</code>!', {first} would be replaced by first name of user. Just like that!
